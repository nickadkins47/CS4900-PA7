## PA7 - Nicholas Adkins

I used UV & installed my packages that way. they can be found in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)

Makefile Targets:

`make train_%`: train model of name `%`
`make run_%`: run model of name `%`

### Video Recordings

I couldn't figure out how to embed them into the markdown file, so here they are:

[PPO](videos/PPO.mp4)

[A2C](videos/A2C.mp4)

[DDPG](videos/DDPG.mp4)

(The SAC videos didnt show up for some reason)
